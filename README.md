# Deep Learning Algorithms for Financial Time Series Forecasting
In this work I will present the implementation of the models of my bachelor's thesis. They are the deep learning algorithms, for the prediction of financial markets through the modeling of financial time series, which constitute the state of the art.
In particular I will propose 3 models:
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
- DCNN-LSTM LOB 

For specifics refer to the folders.

The descriptions of the models, of the setup and of the results are in the sixth chapter of my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XV1dv1LMLhbRa4Sqje2VDgv-HbcW_QfD/view?usp=sharing).

I have uploaded [LOBSTER dataset](https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php) (in particular I have used the LOB file with 10 levels) in the folder dataset.
