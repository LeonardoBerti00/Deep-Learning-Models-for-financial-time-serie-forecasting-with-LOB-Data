# Deep Learning Models for Financial Time Series Forecasting
In this work I will present the implementation of the models of my bachelor's thesis, that I've used during the experiments. They are three deep learning models, for the prediction of mid-price movements using limit order book data.
In particular I will propose these models:
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
- DCNN-LSTM LOB 

For specifics refer to the folders.

I have uploaded the normalized [LOBSTER dataset](https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php) (in particular I have used the LOB file with 10 levels) in the folder dataset.

To run the code you just have to unzip the dataset and change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
