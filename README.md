# Deep Learning Models for Financial Time Series Forecasting
In this work I will present the implementation of the models of my bachelor's thesis. They are three deep learning models, for the prediction of financial markets through the modeling of financial time series.
In particular I will propose these models:
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
- DCNN-LSTM LOB 

For specifics refer to the folders.

The descriptions of the models, of the setup and of the results are in the sixth chapter of my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FU3wgiW-4SVEnE17ZuyMGbsSn24YFUc-/view?usp=sharing).

I have uploaded normalized (only the prices) [LOBSTER dataset](https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php) (in particular I have used the LOB file with 10 levels) in the folder dataset.

To run the code you just have to unzip the dataset and change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
