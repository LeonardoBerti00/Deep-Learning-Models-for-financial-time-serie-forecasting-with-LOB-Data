# Deep Learning Algorithms for Financial Time Series Modeling
In this work I will present the implementation of the models of my bachelor's thesis. They are the deep learning algorithms, for the prediction of financial markets through the modeling of financial time series, which constitute the state of the art.
In particular I will propose 3 models:
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN-LSTM LOB 

For specifics refer to the folders.
The descriptions of the models are in the sixth chapter of my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15veOotQhIFaIkadi-HX6pp7pUjZ5SQ74/view?usp=sharing).
The two dataset used in the esperiments, that are LOBSTER and FI-2010, are accessible in the folder.
