# Deep Learning Algorithms for Financial Time Series Modeling
In this work I will present the implementation of the models of my bachelor's thesis. They are the deep learning algorithms, for the prediction of financial markets through the modeling of financial time series, which constitute the state of the art.
In particular I will propose 3 models:
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN-LSTM LOB 
For specifics refer to the folders.
